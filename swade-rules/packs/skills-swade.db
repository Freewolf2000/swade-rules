A simple success on a Stealth roll means the character avoids detection if enemies aren’t particularly alert. If the character fails the roll, the enemy realizes something is amiss and begins actively searching for whatever roused them.</p>\n<p>Once foes are alerted and active, Stealth is opposed by Notice (a group roll if there are many foes, see page 89).</p>\n<p>The GM should apply any circumstantial penalties to Notice rolls for darkness, cover, noise, distractions, and any difference in the target’s Scale (just like when attacking, see Scale on page 106). Sneaking through dry leaves might subtract 2 from the Stealth roll, for example, while spotting someone in the dark uses the Illumination penalty listed on page 102 (−4). Don’t apply the same modifier to both rolls, however. If Stealth is at −2 for the leaves, don’t give Notice a +2 for them as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Sneak Attack: </strong>Sneaking up close enough to make a melee attack always requires an opposed Stealth roll versus the target’s Notice, whether the guard is actively looking for trouble or not. If successful, the victim is Vulnerable (page 100) to the attacker, but only until the attacker’s turn ends. With a raise, the attacker has The Drop (page 100) instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Movement: </strong>In combat, characters roll Stealth each turn as a free action at the end of their move or any action the GM thinks might draw attention.</p>\n<p>Out of combat, the distance moved depends entirely on the situation. The GM might want a roll every minute if the group is sneaking around the perimeter of a defensive position, or every few miles if they’re trying to quietly walk the path through a dark forest without alerting the creatures that live there.</p>\n<p>SWADE p.35</p>","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"agility","die":{"sides":4,"modifier":""},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"flags":{},"img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/bazaar/systems/swade/assets/assets/icons/skills/hidden.svg","_id":"pxQgyzOmxtCntOVK"}
