{"name":"Social Conflict","permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{},"content":"<p>Not every conflict is won by the blade. Successful oratory can topple nations.</p>\n<p><strong>When to Use These Rules:</strong> Most social exchanges are a simple skill roll resisted by the appropriate Trait, such as Intimidation or Persuasion vs. Spirit. For longer interactions, such as the back and forth of a long argument, negotiation, or a legal proceeding, the following system adds some drama and structure to each side's discussion. (The GM might use a Dramatic Task instead if the argument must be won in a hurry!)</p>\n<p><strong>The Basics: </strong>Characters make arguments back and forth over three rounds, roll their appropriate skills, then consult the <strong>Conflict Results</strong> table (below) to see how well they've influenced their audience.</p>\n<h2>Conflict Rounds</h2>\n<p>The conflict is broken down into three rounds of conversation, each focusing on a particular point (or a few highly connected points).</p>\n<p>During each round, the player roleplays her character's argument and makes a Persuasion roll opposed by the Spirit of whoever she's trying to convince. If a rival argues against her, the roll is opposed by his Persuasion instead.</p>\n<p>Each success and raise by the petitioner grants her an \"Influence Token\" (rivals don't gain tokens, they just oppose the petitioner and keep her from gaining them).</p>\n<p><strong>Modifiers:</strong> Persuasion rolls should be modified by the situation as the GM sees fit. A hero trying to convince a scientist of a fact within his field rolls the lowest of his Persuasion or Science. A particularly brilliant argument or impassioned roleplaying might add +1 to +4. An insult or <em>faux pas</em> inflicts a similar penalty.</p>\n<p>Hindrances should also be considered. Convincing a jury that an Outsider (Major) is innocent of a crime, for example, carries a &minus;2 penalty.</p>\n<h3>Results</h3>\n<p>At the end of the third round, the speaker looks up her total Influence Tokens on the <strong>Social Conflict Results</strong> table below.</p>\n<p><strong>Trials:</strong> Run trials and similar conflicts from the accuser's point of view since they must usually prove the accused's guilt. If the player characters are the defenders, they oppose the prosecution and must keep them from gaining Influence Tokens with the judge (baron, king, warlord, etc.).</p>\n<p>Accusers in a trial must get at least three tokens to convict. Lesser or greater results indicate the degree of punishment based on the setting's customs and laws.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Example: To Arms! </strong>Red must convince a baron to send troops to the defense of a neighboring fiefdom. The barony has warred with his neighbor for generations so the GM decides that's a &minus;4 penalty to Red's Persuasion rolls.</p>\n<p>Worse, she's opposed by his slimy wizard, who argues against the idea every round (he opposes her Persuasion rolls).</p>\n<p>Red gets lucky the first round and gets a success and raise. That's two Influence Tokens. She fails on the second, but gets one more in the third.</p>\n<p>That's three tokens in total. The baron agrees but requires payment in land from his neighbor in return for sending part of his army to his rival's defense.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<table style=\"border-color: #000000; border-style: solid;\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2px\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #910609; text-align: center;\">\n<td style=\"color: #ffffff;\" colspan=\"2\"><strong>SOCIAL CONFLICT RESULTS</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #000000;\">\n<td style=\"width: 76px; color: #ffffff; text-align: center;\"><strong>TOKENS</strong></td>\n<td style=\"color: #ffffff; text-align: center; width: 612px;\"><strong>RESULTS</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #dbd1b7;\">\n<td style=\"width: 76px; text-align: center;\">0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 612px;\">Pleas are denied and negotiations fail.

{"name":"Wealth","permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{},"content":"<p>The fight against evil can sometimes be expensive! The system here makes managing money in the game a bit easier and occasionally dramatic.</p>\n<p><strong>When to Use These Rules: </strong>Use the Wealth system if you want a quick and easy way of handling financial resources without tracking actual currency.</p>\n<p><strong>The Basics: </strong>Characters have a new statistic called Wealth they can use to buy things. It increases when they're rewarded and decreases after significant purchases.</p>\n<h2>Buying Things</h2>\n<p>Each character has a d6 in Wealth, which represents average, middle class resources for the setting. This isn't a Trait, but acts like one—players may spend Bennies when checking it, get their Wild Die, and benefit from allies' Support.</p>\n<p>When a hero wants to buy something mundane, she does so—no roll is required. If the item is more than about $10 × her Wealth die, or she's made numerous recent trivial purchases, she must make a Wealth roll. The GM should add bonuses for savings or deals, subtract penalties for expensive purchases, or rule out all-together purchases beyond the character's means.</p>\n<p>Critical Failure means the buyer can't scrape up the needed funds at the moment but may try again the next week, or after he obtains one or more <strong>Rewards </strong>(see below). With a regular failure, the buyer can either forgo the expense or she can buy it but goes broke regardless of her Wealth die (see below).</p>\n<p>Success means she purchases the item but her Wealth is reduced a die type until the GM feels her finances are restored by time or Rewards. A raise means she buys the item without reducing her Wealth.</p>\n<h3>Going Broke</h3>\n<p>If a hero's Wealth would be reduced below d4, she's dead broke. She has basic food, water, and shelter (unless the GM and the situation dictate otherwise), but otherwise can't buy luxury foods, transportation, or even ammo.</p>\n<h3>Poor Or Rich Characters</h3>\n<p>Wealth is only permanently increased by Rewards or the Rich Edge. It's decreased through use and the Poverty Hindrance. Those with the Poverty Hindrance have a d4 Wealth. Rich characters have a d8, and Very Rich heroes have a d10.</p>\n<p>Heroes with the Fame Edge add +1 to their Wealth rolls or +2 if they're Famous. Not only do they tend to have more money, but people love to give discounts to celebrities.</p>\n<h3>Support Rolls</h3>\n<p>Other characters may Support a hero's Wealth roll, but assume the same risks as the buyer (losing a die type in Wealth with success, for example).</p>\n<h2>Availability</h2>\n<p>If an item isn't commonly available, finding it on the black market, via a private dealer, or in an internet chat room requires the Research skill or <strong>Networking </strong>(page 133).</p>\n<p>The GM can also simply decide the item isn't available or she can assign a modifier to the hero's roll as she sees fit. Finding a firearm in modern-day Europe, for example, is at least a −4 penalty, with serious consequences if the roll is failed.</p>\n<h2>Rewards</h2>\n<p>Getting paid for a job or finding treasure increases the characters' Wealth die one step for an average task, two for a particularly lucrative reward, or three for a very great reward.</p>\n<p>Rewards and cost of living are relative, so the increase lasts only for a month of game time or until the GM thinks the party's lifestyle, carousing, or general living expenses restores it to normal.</p>\n<h2>Negotiating</h2>\n<p>Players love to negotiate with those who hire them, but an increase in cash rarely means anything in actual gameplay. Using this system means a successful negotiation, as well as bounties and rewards, gives them a tangible bonus to their finances. At least for a while!</p>","_id":"TQnjjPgU4iBZodCj"}

Strong winds or currents in the right direction allow them to travel about 60 miles per day. Poor winds or going against the current reduces them to 20 miles per day or less. </em></p>\n<h2>Encounters</h2>\n<p>If an area is dangerous or lawless, draw a card from the Action Deck once per day (or even two or three times a day in particularly dangerous areas). A face card or higher represents an encounter, and the card suit can be used to determine the type.</p>\n<p>Draw twice more if the card is a Joker and combine the results&mdash;such as Enemies and an Obstacle or Strangers and Treasure.</p>\n<p>Game Masters are highly encouraged to customize encounters based on their setting.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>SPADES&mdash;ENEMIES: </strong>Monsters, enemies, or hostile beasts bar the way. Perhaps they lie in ambush if it's a popular path, waiting for the next band of unwary travelers.</li>\n<li><strong>HEARTS&mdash;STRANGERS: </strong>The group comes upon neutral or friendly nonplayer characters such as merchants, lost travelers, a guide, or even other adventurers.</li>\n<li><strong>DIAMONDS &mdash;TREASURE: </strong>Somewhere along the way is something of value&mdash;the hulk of a crashed ship with some remaining supplies waiting to be scavenged, a cache of useful or valuable minerals, or a magic item for sale or guarded by someone or something.</li>\n<li><strong>CLUBS&mdash;OBSTACLE: </strong>The heroes encounter an obstacle of some kind and must figure out how to circumvent it. Some examples are a flooded river, minefields, a decaying rope bridge, whirlpool, etc. The obstacle might also be defended by creatures or enemies as well.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Example: Irradiated Wastes</strong> Red and Gabe are wasteland warriors in Deadlands: Hell on Earth, traversing an area outside of Las Vegas, Nevada, that's been blasted by nuclear \"ghost rock\" bombs.</p>\n<p>The GM draws a Jack of Clubs and decides the area is now a maze of jagged \"glass chasms\" and toxic sinkholes. This slows progress to a crawl for two days and makes them both roll for Fatigue from heat and radiation (see the <strong>Hazards </strong>section, page 125).</p>\n<p>The GM draws again later that day and gets a Queen of Spades. From one of the sinkholes slithers a swarm of irradiated serpents, hungry for fresh prey.</p>\n</blockquote>","_id":"skSvPCfWLdXOytj2"}
