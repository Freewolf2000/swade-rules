{"_id":"9K6xGbVENPGFLrfL","name":"Social Conflict","permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{},"content":"<p>Not every conflict is won by the blade. Successful oratory can topple nations.</p>\n<p><strong>When to Use These Rules:</strong> Most social exchanges are a simple skill roll resisted by the appropriate Trait, such as Intimidation or Persuasion vs. Spirit. For longer interactions, such as the back and forth of a long argument, negotiation, or a legal proceeding, the following system adds some drama and structure to each side's discussion. (The GM might use a Dramatic Task instead if the argument must be won in a hurry!)</p>\n<p><strong>The Basics: </strong>Characters make arguments back and forth over three rounds, roll their appropriate skills, then consult the <strong>Conflict Results</strong> table (below) to see how well they've influenced their audience.</p>\n<h2>Conflict Rounds</h2>\n<p>The conflict is broken down into three rounds of conversation, each focusing on a particular point (or a few highly connected points).</p>\n<p>During each round, the player roleplays her character's argument and makes a Persuasion roll opposed by the Spirit of whoever she's trying to convince. If a rival argues against her, the roll is opposed by his Persuasion instead.</p>\n<p>Each success and raise by the petitioner grants her an \"Influence Token\" (rivals don't gain tokens, they just oppose the petitioner and keep her from gaining them).</p>\n<p><strong>Modifiers:</strong> Persuasion rolls should be modified by the situation as the GM sees fit. A hero trying to convince a scientist of a fact within his field rolls the lowest of his Persuasion or Science. A particularly brilliant argument or impassioned roleplaying might add +1 to +4. An insult or <em>faux pas</em> inflicts a similar penalty.</p>\n<p>Hindrances should also be considered. Convincing a jury that an Outsider (Major) is innocent of a crime, for example, carries a &minus;2 penalty.</p>\n<h3>Results</h3>\n<p>At the end of the third round, the speaker looks up her total Influence Tokens on the <strong>Social Conflict Results</strong> table below.</p>\n<p><strong>Trials:</strong> Run trials and similar conflicts from the accuser's point of view since they must usually prove the accused's guilt. If the player characters are the defenders, they oppose the prosecution and must keep them from gaining Influence Tokens with the judge (baron, king, warlord, etc.).</p>\n<p>Accusers in a trial must get at least three tokens to convict. Lesser or greater results indicate the degree of punishment based on the setting's customs and laws.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Example: To Arms! </strong>Red must convince a baron to send troops to the defense of a neighboring fiefdom. The barony has warred with his neighbor for generations so the GM decides that's a &minus;4 penalty to Red's Persuasion rolls.</p>\n<p>Worse, she's opposed by his slimy wizard, who argues against the idea every round (he opposes her Persuasion rolls).</p>\n<p>Red gets lucky the first round and gets a success and raise. That's two Influence Tokens. She fails on the second, but gets one more in the third.</p>\n<p>That's three tokens in total. The baron agrees but requires payment in land from his neighbor in return for sending part of his army to his rival's defense.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<table style=\"border-color: #000000; border-style: solid;\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2px\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #910609; text-align: center;\">\n<td style=\"color: #ffffff;\" colspan=\"2\"><strong>SOCIAL CONFLICT RESULTS</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #000000;\">\n<td style=\"width: 76px; color: #ffffff; text-align: center;\"><strong>TOKENS</strong></td>\n<td style=\"color: #ffffff; text-align: center; width: 612px;\"><strong>RESULTS</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #dbd1b7;\">\n<td style=\"width: 76px; text-align: center;\">0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 612px;\">Pleas are denied and negotiations fail.

The system here makes managing money in the game a bit easier and occasionally dramatic.</p>\n<p><strong>When to Use These Rules: </strong>Use the Wealth system if you want a quick and easy way of handling financial resources without tracking actual currency.</p>\n<p><strong>The Basics: </strong>Characters have a new statistic called Wealth they can use to buy things. It increases when they're rewarded and decreases after significant purchases.</p>\n<h2>Buying Things</h2>\n<p>Each character has a d6 in Wealth, which represents average, middle class resources for the setting. This isn't a Trait, but acts like one—players may spend Bennies when checking it, get their Wild Die, and benefit from allies' Support.</p>\n<p>When a hero wants to buy something mundane, she does so—no roll is required. If the item is more than about $10 × her Wealth die, or she's made numerous recent trivial purchases, she must make a Wealth roll. The GM should add bonuses for savings or deals, subtract penalties for expensive purchases, or rule out all-together purchases beyond the character's means.</p>\n<p>Critical Failure means the buyer can't scrape up the needed funds at the moment but may try again the next week, or after he obtains one or more <strong>Rewards </strong>(see below). With a regular failure, the buyer can either forgo the expense or she can buy it but goes broke regardless of her Wealth die (see below).</p>\n<p>Success means she purchases the item but her Wealth is reduced a die type until the GM feels her finances are restored by time or Rewards. A raise means she buys the item without reducing her Wealth.</p>\n<h3>Going Broke</h3>\n<p>If a hero's Wealth would be reduced below d4, she's dead broke. She has basic food, water, and shelter (unless the GM and the situation dictate otherwise), but otherwise can't buy luxury foods, transportation, or even ammo.</p>\n<h3>Poor Or Rich Characters</h3>\n<p>Wealth is only permanently increased by Rewards or the Rich Edge. It's decreased through use and the Poverty Hindrance. Those with the Poverty Hindrance have a d4 Wealth. Rich characters have a d8, and Very Rich heroes have a d10.</p>\n<p>Heroes with the Fame Edge add +1 to their Wealth rolls or +2 if they're Famous. Not only do they tend to have more money, but people love to give discounts to celebrities.</p>\n<h3>Support Rolls</h3>\n<p>Other characters may Support a hero's Wealth roll, but assume the same risks as the buyer (losing a die type in Wealth with success, for example).</p>\n<h2>Availability</h2>\n<p>If an item isn't commonly available, finding it on the black market, via a private dealer, or in an internet chat room requires the Research skill or <strong>Networking </strong>(page 133).</p>\n<p>The GM can also simply decide the item isn't available or she can assign a modifier to the hero's roll as she sees fit. Finding a firearm in modern-day Europe, for example, is at least a −4 penalty, with serious consequences if the roll is failed.</p>\n<h2>Rewards</h2>\n<p>Getting paid for a job or finding treasure increases the characters' Wealth die one step for an average task, two for a particularly lucrative reward, or three for a very great reward.</p>\n<p>Rewards and cost of living are relative, so the increase lasts only for a month of game time or until the GM thinks the party's lifestyle, carousing, or general living expenses restores it to normal.</p>\n<h2>Negotiating</h2>\n<p>Players love to negotiate with those who hire them, but an increase in cash rarely means anything in actual gameplay. Using this system means a successful negotiation, as well as bounties and rewards, gives them a tangible bonus to their finances. At least for a while!</p>"}

{"_id":"scO3F6bZ5OAg7wJm","name":"Fear","permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{},"content":"<p>Cold dread seizes the heroine as she enters the lost tomb. A dragon emerges from the cave, belching smoke and fire at the adventurers who threaten its hoard. An investigator stumbles upon a scene of grisly, ritualistic carnage.</p>\n<p>These rules reflect the horror of these terrible situations upon your heroes' psyches.</p>\n<p><strong>When to Use These Rules: </strong>Characters in realistic, horror, or \"dark\" games should usually be subject to the constant effects of fear and terror. Fear in high fantasy or super hero games is probably only used as the effect of a creature ability or arcane power.</p>\n<p><strong>The Basics:</strong> Characters make a Spirit roll when confronted by creatures or situations that cause Fear.</p>\n<h2>Fear Checks</h2>\n<p>The heroes make a Fear check (a Spirit roll as a free action) when they first spot a creature with the Fear ability. Success means a character manages to overcome the situation and carry on. A failed Fear check means the unfortunate soul faces the consequences below, depending on whether the source of fear was grotesque or terrifying in nature:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>NAUSEA:</strong> If the scene was grotesque or horrific, such as a grisly discovery or learning a secret \"Man Was Not Meant to Know,\" the character is Shaken and Fatigued. Critical Failure means the victim must roll on the <strong>Fear Table</strong> as well.</li>\n<li><strong>TERROR: </strong>A terrifying trigger, such as a monstrous creature or unknowable evil, is much more intense. Extras are typically Panicked. Wild Cards must roll on the <strong>Fear Table</strong> (at +2 with a Critical Failure on the Fear check).

The Game Master might require a roll if the heroes encounter such horrors in a particularly different or frightening situation, however.</p>"}

You can roleplay these encounters out, or you can allow them to use their skills in a \"macro\" sense&mdash;summing up hours of effort with a single roll.</p>\n<p>Persuasion is the nice way of interacting with one's contacts. The flip side of the coin is Intimidation. Either can get the job done but in slightly different ways, as shown below.</p>\n<p><strong>When to Use These Rules:</strong> Networking is a good way for social characters to spend their time while bookworm types are doing Research.</p>\n<p><strong>The Basics:</strong> Characters use their Persuasion or Intimidation to gather favors or information. As always, the GM should apply any bonuses or penalties appropriate to the situation.</p>\n<h2>Persuasion (The Nice Way)</h2>\n<p>Characters use Persuasion to socialize within their various social circles for information or favors. When used in this way, Persuasion isn't a single exchange but several hours of networking, hobnobbing, carousing, drinks, gifts, bribes, or entertaining. This might represent time at the office, a series of meetings with important people, or (most commonly) an evening of dinner and drinks.</p>\n<p>Success grants most of what the character wants, though it may take a while, cost some money, or require a favor in return. A raise either gets more of whatever he was looking for, or at a lower cost.</p>\n<p>Failure means the hero's efforts are in vain. A Critical Failure means he's cut off from that particular group for a while (up to the GM but typically about a week).</p>\n<p><strong>Money Talks:</strong> You can catch more flies with honey than vinegar, the saying goes. A character with a little lucre to spread around adds +2 to her networking attempt by spending money on better bribes, gifts, or wining and dining her contacts.</p>\n<p>The amount required is up to the GM, the setting, and the nature of the contact(s) she interacts with. As a rule of thumb, use the setting's Starting Funds and modify as appropriate from there.</p>\n<h2>Intimidation (The Not-so-Nice Way)</h2>\n<p>Intimidation can also be used to gather information, call in favors, or make demands, but it's a little less savory.</p>\n<p>Each attempt to \"work the streets\" takes several hours of threats and general unpleasantness, rousting the local populace for whatever the hero needs.</p>\n<p>Success grants the character most of what she wants, though her victims might decide to get some payback later on. A raise means she gets more info, gets it faster, or her victims are too scared or otherwise preoccupied to plot revenge.</p>\n<p>Failure means the goon doesn't get anything useful. A Critical Failure means she ends the evening with a fat lip, black eye, or broken nose (see <strong>Bumps &amp; Bruises</strong>, page 125). She can work her contacts again the next day, but they're more likely to be waiting for her this time!</p>\n<p><strong>Busting Heads: </strong>The bruiser can improve her odds by getting more violent or extreme than usual. This alienates her contacts for a week but adds +2 to the roll.</p>\n<p>This raises the stakes as well. A simple failure means the evening ends with <strong>Bumps &amp; Bruises</strong> (page 125), and a Critical Failure bears more serious consequences. The GM might break the action down to an actual encounter (which might be an ambush!), she might run afoul of the law, come back with two levels of Fatigue from Bumps &amp; Bruises, or her questions might trigger a deadly reaction from a more powerful enemy!</p>\n<h2>Example: Savage Mojo</h2>\n<p>Gabe is a private eye in <em>Deadlands Noir</em>. He needs to find out where the Red Hand, an evil voodoo cult in New Orleans, has taken the District Attorney.</p>\n<p>Gabe's Intimidation is better than his Persuasion, and he has the Menacing Edge that adds +2 to Intimidation rolls. Time is tight so he decides to bust some heads. That adds another +2 to his roll. With the +4 bonus he gets a success and a raise. Gabe finds where the DA is being held and how many guards are with her as well.</p>","_id":"JfXeqEh9v9H3PRvu"}
