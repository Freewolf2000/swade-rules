{"name":"Area Effect Attacks","permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{},"content":"<p>Grenades, spell effects, breath weapons, and other attacks that cover a large area are \"area effect attacks.\" The most common are Small, Medium, and Large Blast Templates, and the Cone Template. There are copies you can print out on our website and we make durable acrylic versions as well.</p>\n<p>Cone templates are placed with the small end emanating from the attacker and fired with the Shooting skill (or Athletics for breath weapons and other natural attacks).</p>\n<p>A basic success means the cone stays where the user intended, and a raise causes additional damage as usual. Those beneath the template are hit, or may <strong>Evade </strong>(page 100), if the attack allows it.</p>\n<p>Failure means the attack didn't occur for some reason &mdash; the creature failed to belch up noxious gas, the flamethrower malfunctioned, etc.</p>\n<p>To attack with a blast template, the player places the template and rolls Shooting or Athletics (for thrown weapons or breath attacks). If the attack is successful, the blast lands where desired. See <strong>Deviation</strong>, below for failure.</p>\n<p>Any target even partially beneath either type of template is affected. If the effect causes damage, roll for each victim separately. Attacks that hit with a raise cause bonus damage as usual.</p>\n<h2>Deviation</h2>\n<p>If an attack with a Cone Template fails, it goes over the targets' heads, hits the ground, or simply falters for some reason. The GM may still decide the attack affects the area around it&mdash;perhaps a flamethrower sets a room on fire or a gas canister spews a cloud of gas&mdash; but there's no game effect on characters or other targets this time.</p>\n<p>If a blast template misses, it deviates 1d6&Prime; for thrown weapons (such as grenades) and 2d6&Prime; for fired projectiles. Multiply by 2 if the attack was made at Medium Range, 3 if Long, and 4 for Extreme.</p>\n<p>Next roll a d12 and read it like a clock facing to determine the direction the missile deviates. A weapon can never deviate more than half the distance to the original target (that keeps it from going behind the thrower).</p>\n<h2>Cover &amp; Area Effect Attacks</h2>\n<p>Solid obstacles like trees or brick walls protect against area effect attacks if they're between the origin of the blast and the GM reasonably thinks they'd apply.

The sticky web of a giant spider, for example, might note that escape attempts are made at −2 or more. This is an action, and success works just like breaking free from a foe (explained above).</p>\n<p>Characters and allies may also destroy the entanglement (see <strong>@Compendium[world.swade-rules.23C1hDByyHBjWSsd]{Breaking Things}</strong>, page 98). Webs, ropes, nets, and the like are generally Hardness 4 and must be cut with an edged weapon.</p>"}
